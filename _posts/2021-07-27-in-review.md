* **Branch deploy**: a deploy generated from a branch that is not your production branch. Branch deploys are published to a URL which includes the branch name as a prefix. For example, if a branch is called `staging`, it will deploy to `staging--yoursitename.netlify.app`. If you use Netlify DNS, you can enable branch subdomains, so the `staging` branch example would deploy to `staging.yourcustomdomain.com`.
